The Galileo 2 Standalone (G2SA) is designed as an Orbiter 2.0 or Sherpa Mini drop-in replacement extruder and utilizes the G2E kit parts for assembly.  This expands the printer lineup for G2 to any printer compatible with the Orbiter 2.0 or Sherpa Mini, and gives the benefits noted above for G2E to every compatible printer.  The G2SA is also a lightweight extruder, comparable to the Orbiter 2.0.
