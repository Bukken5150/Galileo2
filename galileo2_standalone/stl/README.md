## Galileo 2 Standalone (G2SA) STL Files

As a general rule, you will need to print one of each of the STL files included here.  Parts meant to be printed in accent color are marked with "[a]" in front of the file name.

Certain STL files are applicable to different printer options, such as the type of extruder mounting used, and will need a SINGLE option printed from multiple options available.

For G2SA, here is the list of STL files that you need to choose a SINGLE option from:
* For Orbiter 2.0-style mounting:
 	* <ins>[a]_front_plate_orbiter2_mount x1.stl</ins>
 	* <ins>main_body_ECAS_orbiter2_mount x1.stl</ins>
 		* For users NOT wanting to utilize the ECAS bowden coupler, please use <ins>main_body_orbiter2_mount x1.stl</ins> instead of <ins>main_body_ECAS_orbiter2_mount.stl</ins>
* For Sherpa Mini-style mounting:
 	* <ins>[a]_front_plate_sherpa_mini_mount x1.stl</ins>
 	* <ins>main_body_ECAS_sherpa_mini_mount x1.stl</ins>
 		* For users NOT wanting to utilize the ECAS bowden coupler, please use <ins>main_body_sherpa_mini_mount x1.stl</ins> instead of <ins>main_body_ECAS_sherpa_mini_mount.stl</ins>
